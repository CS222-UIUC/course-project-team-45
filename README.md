# UIUC Class Path Optimizer

  Our UIUC Class Path Optimizer project allows students from UIUC to input their schedules, and our site will display the routes between their classes along with the distances and time.
  As you first visit the site, you will see our main page containing the pictures taken on UIUC. Along the top part of the page contains the menu containing links to the site’s other pages. This menu will be present on each page of our site. The UIUC Class Path Optimizer will bring you to the home or main page.
  The Class Input link brings you to our page that allows you to input and create your schedule. As you search and submit your classes, you can click on the corresponding box containing a class section. Your computer’s local storage will store your class sections as you build your schedule. After you put in your schedule, you will click on “Sort Schedule!” to sort your schedule by time.
  The Map link will bring you to the main part of our project. Click on a day in the left side box, and click on “Display My Route!” This will display the route on the map on the right side along with the  distances and times between each class.
The About Us link will bring you to our page that showcases the info of each teammate including our GitHub, LinkedIn, and more.

In order to have our code properly be displayed, you must create your own API key in the TomTom API website. You will need to create an account to be able to generate  your key. Once you receive your personal API key, go to tomtom.js in the tomtom folder. In there, you will adjust the variable APIKEY from config.APIKEY to your personal API key (be sure to use “ ”). Then, use an extension to view the website (we recommend “Live Server” if you are using VSCode). Once you pull the website, have fun exploring through it! 

Savannah was responsible for the frontend part of the project, and she chose the color scheme and provided pictures for the main page.
Nehal and Daniel both worked on working with our UIUC class data API and incorporating that data into our Class Input page.
Tiffany and Savannah were responsible for working with the TomTom API and using the APIs functions to create the map page.
