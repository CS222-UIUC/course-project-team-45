# UIUC Class Path Optimizer

  Our UIUC Class Path Optimizer project allows students from UIUC to input their schedules, and our website will display the routes between their classes along with the distances and time. 
 	As you first visit the website, you will see our main page containing the pictures taken on UIUC. Along the top part of the page contains the menu containing links to the website’s other pages. This menu will be present on each page of our website. The UIUC Class Path Optimizer will bring you to the home or main page. 
  The Class Input link brings you to our page that allows you to input and create your schedule. As you search and submit your classes, you can click on the corresponding box containing a class section. Your computer’s local storage will store your class sections as you build your schedule. After you put in your schedule, you will click on “Sort Schedule!” to sort your schedule by time.
  The Map link will bring you to the main part of our project. Click on a day in the left side box, and click on “Display My Route!” This will display the route on the map on the right side along with the  distances and times between each class.
The About Us link will bring you to our page that showcases the info of each teammate including our Github, LinkedIn, and more.

Nehal and Daniel both worked on working with our UIUC class data API and incorporating that data into our Class Input page.
Tiffany was responsible for working with the TomTom API and using the API’s functions to create the map page.
